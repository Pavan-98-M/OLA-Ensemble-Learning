# Ola Driver Attrition Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts driver churn for Ola by analyzing 19,000+ driver performance, income, and service-related records. The goal is to identify at-risk drivers early and support data-driven retention strategies to reduce high acquisition costs.

## Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-Learn | XGBoost | SMOTE | Matplotlib | Seaborn

## Project Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (service months, income growth, rating change)
- Model building using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix

## Performance
- Best model achieved ~79% test accuracy

## Key Insights
- Shorter service duration and low rating improvement indicate higher churn risk
- Income growth and business value are strong predictors
- Findings support targeted retention planning

## Business Impact
Improves early churn detection for cost-effective driver retention and reduced operational expense.

## Future Enhancements
- SHAP-based model explainability
- Deployment using Streamlit or Flask
- Real-time churn prediction dashboard
